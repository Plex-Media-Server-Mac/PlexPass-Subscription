PlexPass is a premium subscription service that elevates your Plex media server with a suite of powerful, exclusive features. It is designed for power users who demand the most from their personal streaming setup. A PlexPass subscription unlocks capabilities that enhance performance, increase convenience, and provide deeper control over your media ecosystem.

Subscribers enjoy hardware-accelerated streaming, which significantly reduces the server's workload by using supported hardware for efficient video transcoding. The ability to sync media to mobile devices for offline viewing is a game-changer for travel. Additional perks include early access to new features, premium music libraries with lyrics support via Lyricfind, custom trailers and extras for your movie library, and robust parental controls. PlexPass is the key to transforming a standard media server into a professional-grade entertainment system.
